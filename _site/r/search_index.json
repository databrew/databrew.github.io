What is this website? This is not a textbook or an encyclopedia. This is not a reference manual. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive. We barely mention statistical tests at all. There is almost no theory. In fact, this curriculum is biased, non-representative, and incomplete – by design. So what is this? This website is a guide designed to help you through the most dangerous period in your data science education: your very first steps. The first few weeks. That is when 99% percent of people give up on learning to code. You want to be part of the 1%? Okay, then you need to understand these 3 things: Premise 1: We learn best by doing. Our goal is to get you doing data science. We will keep theory and detail to a minimum. We will give you the absolute basics, then offer you exercises and puzzles that motivate you to learn the rest. Then, once you’ve been doing data science for a bit, you soon begin thinking like a data scientist. By that, we mean tackling ambiguous problems with persistence, independence, and creative problem solving. With the focus on doing (as opposed to listening, reading, watching, etc.), the burden is on you. You gotta do the work. Premise 2: We learn best with purpose. Once you gain comfort with the basic skills, you will be able to start working on real data, for real projects, with real impact. You will start to care about what you are coding. And that is when the learning curve skyrockets – because you are motivated, and because you are learning reactively, instead of preemptively. Our goal is to get you to the point of take-off as quickly as possible. Premise 3: A simple toolbox is all you need to build a house. Once you become comfortable with a few basic coding tools, you can build pretty much anything. The toolbox doesn’t need to be that big; if you know how to use your tools well, and if you have enough building supplies (i.e., data), the possibilities are limitless. One more thing that this is not: This is not a fancy interactive tutorial with bells or whistles. We purposefully designed this to be simple and “analog”. You will not be typing your code into this website and getting feedback from a robot, or setting up an account to track your progress, or getting pretty merit badges or points when you complete each module. Instead, you will be doing your work on your own machine, working with real folders and files, downloading data and moving it around, etc. – all the things you will be doing as a real data scientist in the real world. Who this is for This curriculum covers everything from the absolute basics of writing code in R to machine learning. As such, it is designed to be useful to everyone in some way. But the target audience for these tutorials is the rookie: the student who wants to work with data but has zero formal training in programming, computer science, or statistics. What you will learn The Getting started unit teaches you how to use R (in RStudio). Here you will add the first and most important tools to your toolbox: working with variables, vectors, dataframes, scripts, and file directories.
