## Introduction  

**Weather data matters to many**: Weather data is useful across many disciplines: epidemiologists use it to predict the incidence of diseases associated with rainfall (malaria) or humidity (influenza); economists monitor for its effect on things like crop yield, commodity prices, or even [violence](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/opinion/sunday/weather-and-violence.html). It's a topic of daily elevator conversation and human interest. 

**Weather data is inaccessible to most**: But to most analysts, even those with a great deal of experience, accessing consistent, high quality weather data is difficult. There are plenty of services with current conditions and forecasts, but not historical information. When data is available, it's often unclear which combination of sources was used, the extent to which values are estimated versus observed, nor how the data were retrieved or processed prior to exposition. In fact, the market for weather data is so opaque that an entire industry has sprung up around packaging government weather data into easy-to-use formats (APIs and bulk downloads).

## The `gsod` package

That's where the `gsod` package comes in. High quality, de-aggregated weather data exists, and is usually both collected and maintained by governments. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay twice for the privelege of accessing it. The US [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's](https://data.noaa.gov/) [Global Surface Summary of the Day](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod) data, for example, go back for nearly two dozen years, and contain information such as temperature, wind, humidity, rainfall, etc. from more than 9,000 weather stations. DataBrew's new `gsod` package makes using those data easy, even for beginners.

## Let's explore the weather.  

To get started, head over to the [gsod package page](https://github.com/databrew/gsod) and follow instructions for package download / installation. Got it? Good. Now let's settle the debate once and for all: which has better weather, the Dutch capital of Amsterdam or the Catalan capital of Barcelona.

```{r}

# Get weather for 2012-2016
library(gsod)
weather <- bind_rows(gsod2012,
                      gsod2013,
                      gsod2014,
                      gsod2015,
                      gsod2016)
```

Now we'll find the nearest weather stations to our locations of interest through the `gsod` package's `find_nearest_station` function:

```{r}

# Get the station ids
ids <- bind_rows(find_nearest_station('Amsterdam, Netherlands'),
                 find_nearest_station('Barcelona, Catalonia'))
ids
```

Next, we'll plot our weather stations on a world map:

```{r}

library(rworldmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(databrew)
world <- map_data(map="world")

g <- 
  ggplot() + 
  theme_databrew() +
  geom_map(data=world, 
           map=world,
           aes(map_id=region, x=long, y=lat),
           fill = 'lightblue',
           alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_point(data = ids,
             aes(x = lon,
                 y = lat),
             alpha = 0.6,
             size = 3,
             color = 'red') +
  labs(x = 'Longitude',
       y = 'Latitude') +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  geom_label_repel(data = ids,
             aes(x = lon,
                 y = lat,
                 label = stn_name),
             alpha = 0.7,
             size = 2)
```

<div class="row">
<div class="3u 12u(narrower)">
</div>
<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
<div class="image featured">

```{r, echo = FALSE}
g
```

</div>  
</div>
<div class="3u 12u(narrower)">
</div>
</div>

To start, we'll have a look at the daily high and low temperatures. 


```{r}

# Get weather for only our two stations
weather <- weather %>%
  filter(stnid %in% ids$stnid)
# Make long tidy data for plotting temperatures
long <- weather %>%
  dplyr::select(date, max, min, stn_name) %>%
  gather(key, value, max:min)
# Compare temperature
g <- ggplot(data = long,
       aes(x = date,
           y = value,
           color = key)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~stn_name) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  scale_color_manual(name = '',
                     values = c('blue', 'red')) +
  theme_databrew() +
  labs(x = 'Date',
       y = 'Degrees (celcius)')
```

<div class="row">
<div class="3u 12u(narrower)">
</div>
<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
<div class="image featured">

```{r, echo = FALSE}
g
```

</div>  
</div>
<div class="3u 12u(narrower)">
</div>
</div>



For many, rainfall matters more than temperature. Let's have a look at the percentage of days per month which have any precipitation:

```{r}
rain <- weather %>%
  mutate(month = format(date, '%m')) %>%
  group_by(month, stn_name) %>%
  summarise(rainy = length(which(prcp > 0)),
            days = n()) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(p = rainy / days * 100)

ggplot(data = rain,
       aes(x = month,
           y = p,
           color = stn_name,
           group = stn_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_databrew() +
  scale_color_manual(name = '',
                     values = c('blue', 'red')) +
  labs(x = 'Month',
       y = 'Percentage',
       title = 'Percentage of days which are rainy') +
  ylim(0,100)
```


## Conclusion

Amsterdam is great if you like the cold and the rain.
