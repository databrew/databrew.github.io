                    <p>(Note that this article is a revision of the <a href="http://databrew.cc/posts/catalonia_original.html" target="_blank">original post</a>. After some critical, but very helpful, feedback from an astute reader, we made some changes in order to "de-bias" the editorial content, a bit. This resulted in no changes to the data shown (which are simple aggregations and percentages), but did result in some changes to the text describing those data. Thank you to the reader for the constructive suggestions.)</p>

                    <p>Catalonia has gotten a lot of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41551466" target="_blank">press</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/world/europe/catalonia-spain-president-quim-torra.html" target="_blank">lately</a>. Though the independence "process" in Catalonia has been going on for some years now, events took a major turn in October when the Catalan government attempted to hold a referendum for independence (illegal per Spanish law, and boycotted by most Catalan unionists). <a href = 'http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-41463955/catalonia-referendum-violence-as-police-block-voting' target='_blank'>Violence</a> ensued between <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-catalan-independence-extra-police-funding-protests-madrid-catalonia-a8166611.html" target="_blank">police</a> and those who attempted to vote. The Catalan government was disbanded by Madrid, several politicians, including the vice president were placed in preventive detention (where they remain today), several others,including the president, fled to neighboring countries (where they remain today), elections were called, and those in favor of independence won a parliamentary majority in the elections.</p>

                    
                    <p>Independentists argue that Spain's handling of the crisis has been unnecessarily violent and ignores <a href="https://theconversation.com/self-determination-is-legal-under-international-law-its-hypocritical-to-argue-otherwise-for-catalonia-86558" target="_blank">international norms regarding self-determination</a>. Those against independence point out that the Catalan government broke Spanish law by holding the referendum in the first place and that Spain is a democracy, adding that independence is fueled by xenophobia, and that the Spanish state was obligated to protect itself against what was essentially a "coup d'Ã©tat". Both sides claim that the majority of Catalans are on their side.</p>

                    <p>In order to understand the situation, it's important to go beyond the personalities and rhetoric and get the facts. Using data from the most recent survey of the <a href='http://ceo.gencat.cat/ca/inici' target='_blank'>The Center for Opinion Studies</a> (CEO for its acronym in Catalan), we explore the view of those living in Catalonia. What follows are six essential facts for understanding the Catalan crisis:</p>
              

                    <h3><strong>1. The independence movement may have time on its side </strong></h3>
                    

                    <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>If you're hoping for Spain and Catalonia to work things out, then time is working against you. Just as demographics favored the  legalization of gay marriage and marijuana in the United States <a href='http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/' target='_blank'>(where the young are for and the old are against)</a>, views on independence by age group suggest that the increasing trend in favor of independence may continue over time, as the young replace the old. After all, in Catalonia, the only age at which most are opposed to independence is 65 or older:</p>
                    
                     <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3><strong>2. The independence movement is not as similar to Brexit as it may appear</strong></h3>
                    
                    

                    <p>In the media, Catalan independence is often clumped together with Brexit as both "anti-European", reactionary movements. But if you dig deeper, the Brexit similarities are slim. For example, the Brexit "leave" vote was heavily correlated with <a href='https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-education-higher-university-study-university-leave-eu-remain-voters-educated-a7881441.html' target='_blank'>lower levels of education</a> (ie, the more education one had, the less likely they were to vote to leave the EU).</p> 

                    <div class="image featured">

                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/brexit.png" style="max-width: 400px;" align="middle">
                    </div>

                    <p>The Catalan "leave" vote is also heavily correlated with education, but in the opposite direction; in Catalonia, having completed higher levels of education is associated with a greater likelihood of wanting independence from Spain (albeit this is confounded by age and wealth):</p>

                    <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>


<div class="image text">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/ines.jpg"/>
                            </div>
                    <p>In regards to views on the EU, both sides have tried to lay claim to being more "European" than the other. Independentists point to recent legal success to prevent extradition; unionists point out that leaving Spain also means leaving the EU. The pro-union side has had a bit more success on the who-is-more-European front. In fact, one of the most vocal pro-union parties in Spain, <a href='https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/' target='_blank'>Ciudadanos</a> has made being "European" a main tenant of their party's appeal. Ines Arrimadas, the Ciudadanos leader in Catalonia (whose party won the most votes in the recent Catalan elections), distinguishes the <a href='https://www.politico.eu/article/ines-arrimadas-catalonia-ciudadanos-party-carles-puigdemont-mariano-rajoy-interview-takes-no-prisoners/' target='_blank'>"nationalism that they (the independentists) represent and the europeismo that our movement represents"</a>.</p> 

                    <p>Though it is true that unionists have a more positive view of the EU than independentists, the characterization of the movement as anti-European (in the same vein as Brexit "leavers") doesn't hold up entirely. The difference between unionists' and independentists' views of the European Union (on a 0-10 scale, with 10 being most favorable) is only 1.3 / 1 points (mean and median, respectively), with wide variance on both sides. In other words, in regards to their view of the EU, independentists and unionists are relatively similar:</p>
                    
                          <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                                        <p>Another indicator of the "European-ness" of the Catalan independent movement is the view of non-Spanish Europeans living in Catalonia (albeit, a very small sample size in this poll). Unlike non-Europeans and non-Catalan Spaniards, Europeans living in Catalonia are relatively ambivalent in regards to independence, with slightly more in favor than against:</p>
                    
                    <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Both those for and against independence are much more in agreement with each other in regards to their views of the European Union than they are on more controversial topics, such as their views of the Spanish monarchy and military.</p>
                    
                     <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                    
                    <h3><strong>3. Party predicts language</strong></h3>
                    
                    <p>In the debate over Catalan independence, there is a lot of discussion about history, democracy, rule of law, legality, etc. But when you boil  it all down, what's left is language. Pro-independence parties (left) largely consist of those for whom Catalan is their main language. Pro-union parties (right) are even more linguistically concentrated, largely consisting of Spanish speakers:</p>
                    
                    	<div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>
                    
                
                    
                    <h3><strong>4. It IS a revolution of the bourgeoisie</strong></h3>
                    
                    <p>Those opposed to independence mock the movement by calling it a revolution of the "bourgeoisie", pointing out that it's mostly the rich who are in favor of breaking away. The data say that they're right - in general, the poor in Catalonia are against independence, whereas the rich are for it.</p>
                    
                    	<div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3><strong>5. It's a close split</strong></h3>
                    
                    <p>More Catalans are for independence than are against it. But the breakdown isn't far from 50/50, and any major swing in the "not sure" group could re-shuffle the order:</p>
                    
                    					<div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>

                    <h3><strong>6. It's about "identity"</strong></h3>
                    
                    <p>Much of the media coverage focuses on the economic and political implications of indendependence versus union, but preferences appear to fall much more in line with identity than typical political debates. Those who feel only or mostly Catalan are overwhelmingly independentist; those who feel mostly or only Spanish are overwhelmingly against independence:</p>
                    
                                        <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>

                    <p>The identity aspect of the debate is one reason that it's difficult to classify into a typical left-right spectrum - both the Spanish left (Socialists/Podemos) and right (Ciudadanos, PP, VOX) are against independence, whereas the "Catalanista" left (ERC/CUP) and right (PDeCat) are fairly united for it.</p>
