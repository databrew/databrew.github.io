                    <div class="image text">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png"/>
                            </div>

                    <p>Catalonia has gotten a lot of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41551466" target="_blank">press</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/world/europe/catalonia-spain-president-quim-torra.html" target="_blank">lately</a>. Though the independence "process" in Catalonia has been going on for some years now, events took a major turn in October when the Catalan government held a referendum for independence (boycotted by unionists and declared illegal by Madrid). The Spanish government spent  <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-catalan-independence-extra-police-funding-protests-madrid-catalonia-a8166611.html" target="_blank">87 million euros</a> to ship in police from outside of Catalonia, many of whom <a href = 'https://spanishpolice.github.io/' target='_blank'> beat voters with clubs</a> on the day of the referendum. The Catalan government was disbanded by Madrid, elections were called, and those in favor of independence won the elections.</p>
                    

                    
                    <p>Independentists argue that Spain's handling of Catalan calls for seld-determination is heavy-handed, unnecessarily violent, and even violates international law. Those against independence say that the Catalan government broke Spanish law by holding the referendum in the first place, that independence is fueled by xenophobia, and that the Spanish state was obligated to protect itself against what was essentially a "coup d'Ã©tat". Both sides claim that the majority of Catalans are on their side.</p>
                    <p>In order to understand the situation, it's important to go beyond the personalities and rhetoric and get the facts. Using data from the most recent survey of the <a href='http://ceo.gencat.cat/ca/inici' target='_blank'>The Center for Opinion Studies</a> (CEO for its acronym in Catalan), we explore the view of those living in Catalonia. What follows are five essential facts for understanding the Catalan crisis:</p>
              

                    <h3><strong>1. The independence movement has time on its side </strong></h3>
                    

                    <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>If you're hoping for Spain and Catalonia to work things out, then time is working against you. Just as demographics favored the inevitable legalization of gay marriage in the United States <a href='http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/' target='_blank'>(where the young are for and the old are against)</a>, views on independence by age group suggest that Catalonia's independence is a question of <b>when</b>, not if.</p> 
                    <p>The only age at which most are opposed to independence is among those who are 65 or older</p>
                    
                     <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3><strong>2. The independence movement is not anti-European </strong></h3>
                    
                    <div class="image text">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/ines.jpg"/>
                            </div>

                    <p>From the surface, one might be tempted to clump together Catalan independence with Brexit as both "anti-European", reactionary movements. In fact, one of the most vocal anti-indepenence parties in Spain, <a href='https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/' target='_blank'>Ciudadanos</a> has made being "European" a main tenant of their party's rhetoric. Ines Arrimadas, the Ciudadanos leader in Catalonia, distinguishes the <a href='https://www.politico.eu/article/ines-arrimadas-catalonia-ciudadanos-party-carles-puigdemont-mariano-rajoy-interview-takes-no-prisoners/' target='_blank'>"nationalism that they (the independentists) represent and the europeismo that our movement represents"</a>.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>But if you dig deeper, the Brexit/anti-Europe comparison doesn't hold up. In fact, the Catalan independence movement has a lot more in common with its Scottish counterpart, in that most Catalans favor remaining in the EU. The difference between unionists and independentists views of the European Union (on a 0-10 scale, with 10 being most favorable) is only 1.3 points:</p>
                    
                          <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                                        <p>Another indicator of the "European-ness" of the Catalan independent movement is the view of non-Spanish Europeans living in Catalonia (albeit, a very small sample size in this poll). Unlike non-Europeans and non-Catalan Spaniards, Europeans living in Catalonia generally are pro-independence:</p>
                    
                    <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Importantly, those for and against independence are much more in agreement with each other in regards to their views of the European Union than they are on more controversial topics, such as their views of the Spanish monarchy and military.</p>
                    
                     <div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;" align="middle">
                    </div>
                    
                        <p>In other words, the data do not support the characterization of the Catalan independence movement as being anti-European: differences between unionists and independentists are more pronounced in regards to their views on the monarchy and the military than on the European Union.</p>
                    
                    <h3><strong>3. Party predicts language</strong></h3>
                    
                    <p>In the debate over Catalan independence, there is a lot of discussion about history, democracy, rule of law, legality, etc. But when you boil  it all down, what's left is language. Pro-independence parties (left) largely consist of those for whom Catalan is their main language. Pro-union parties (right) are even more linguistically concentrated, largely consisting of Spanish speakers:</p>
                    
                    	<div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>
                    
                
                    
                    <h3><strong>4. The educated and rich are driving the movement</strong></h3>
                    <p>Those in favor of indepenence point to the fact that those who are most educated are generally most enthusiastic about divorce with Spain:</p>
                    
                    	<div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Those opposed to independence call it a revolution of the "bourgeoisie", pointing out that it's mostly the rich who are in favor of breaking away.</p>
                    
                    	<div class="image featured">
                            <img src="../images/blog/catalonia/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3><strong>5. Most Catalans want independence</strong></h3>
                    
                    <p>There is one fact that gets lost in all the clamor about whether independence is a good idea or a bad idea, whether it's legal or illegal, or what it means for the future of Europe and the world: more Catalans are for independence than are against it.</p>
