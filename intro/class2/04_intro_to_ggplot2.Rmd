## Create a variable for month

```{r}
weather$month <- format(weather$date, '%m')
```

## Create a variable for year

```{r}
weather$year <- format(weather$date, '%Y')
```

## Introducing the `dplyr` package {.build}

`dplyr` is very useful

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## Get the average temperature per month

```{r}
x <- 
  weather %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(average_temperature = mean(temp_mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Visualization of average temperature

```{r}
plot(x = x$month,
     y = x$average_temperature)
```

## Get and visualize the average daily max temperature per month

1. Create an object called `y`
2. In that object, group by month and get max temperature
3. Make a plot

## Creating lots of variables in dplyr
