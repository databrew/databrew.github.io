## Citations / Bibliography

- One of the key components of reproducible research is that EVERYTHING GETS CODED.
- Another key component is that EVERYTHING IS OPEN SOURCE (free).

## How to do reproducible bibliography management

- Use the bibtex format: `bibligraphy.bib`

## What does this look like?

```
@article{Galatas2016,
  doi = {10.1186/s12936-016-1496-y},
  url = {https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-016-1496-y},
  year  = {2016},
  month = {aug},
  publisher = {Springer Nature},
  volume = {15},
  number = {1},
  author = {Beatriz Galatas and Caterina Guinovart and Quique Bassat and John J. Aponte and L{\'{\i}}dia Nham{\'{u}}ssua and Eusebio Macete and Francisco Sa{\'{u}}te and Pedro Alonso and Pedro Aide},
  title = {A prospective cohort study to assess the micro-epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria in Ilha Josina Machel (Manhi{\c{c}}a,  Mozambique)},
  journal = {Malaria Journal}
}
```

## Workflow

- Create a project
- Create a bib file
- Indicate to R that you're using a bibliography file

```
