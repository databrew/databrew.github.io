## How was the homework?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- -10:2
y <- c(rep(0, 5),
       1, 
       0, 
       1,
       1, 
       3,
       10,
       2,
       10)
plot(x, y, type = 'l',
     xlab = 'Days until homework due',
     ylab = 'Number of people asking for help')
```

## Comments on homework

- Use comments
- Send the R script
- It's okay to have problems.
- It's supposed to be hard!

## Difficulty

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- 1:10
y <- c(1:8, 4, 1)^2
plot(x, y,
     type = 'l',
     xlab = 'Level of difficulty',
     ylab = 'Amount of learning')
points(x = 8, y = 8^2,
       col = 'red')
```

## For next homework

- Ask for help!
