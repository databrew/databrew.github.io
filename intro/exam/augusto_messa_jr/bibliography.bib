@article{Halliez2013,
abstract = {Giardiasis is the most common waterborne parasitic infection of the human intestine worldwide. The etiological agent, Giardia duodenalis (syn. G. intestinalis, G. lamblia), is a flagellated, binucleated protozoan parasite which infects a wide array of mammalian hosts. Human giardiasis is a true cosmopolitan pathogen, with highest prevalence in developing countries. Giardiasis can present with a broad range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic, to acute or chronic diarrheal disease associated with abdominal pain and nausea. Most infections are self-limiting, although re-infection and chronic infection can occur. Recent evidence indicating that Giardia may cause chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal complications have made it a topic of intense research. The causes of the post-infectious clinical manifestations due to Giardia, even after complete elimination of the parasite, remain obscure. This review offers a state-of-the-art discussion on the long-term consequences of Giardia infections, from extra-intestinal manifestations, growth and cognitive deficiencies, to post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. The discussion also sheds light on some of the novel mechanisms recently implicated in the production of these post-infectious manifestations.},

abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is considered the most common protozoan infecting humans worldwide. Molecular characterization of G. duodenalis isolates has revealed the existence of eight groups (assemblages A to H) which differ in their host distribution. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 639 children from La Habana between January and December 2013. Two assemblage-specific PCRs were carried out for the molecular characterization. The overall prevalence of Giardia infection was 11.9{\%}. DNA from 63 of 76 (82.9{\%}) samples was successfully amplified by PCR-tpi, while 58 from 76 (76.3{\%}) were detected by PCRE1-HF. Similar results by both PCRs were obtained in 54 from 76 samples (71{\%}). According to these analyses, assemblage B and mixed assemblages A + B account for most of the Giardia infections in the cohort of children tested. Our current study identified assemblage B as predominant genotype in children infected with Giardia. Univariate analysis indicated that omission of washing hands before eating and keeping dogs at home were significant risk factors for a Giardia infection. In the future, novel molecular tools for a better discrimination of assemblages at the subassemblages level are needed to verify possible correlations between Giardia genotypes and symptomatology of giardiasis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The protozoan Giardia duodenalis is a common but highly diverse human parasite that comprises a complex of seven morphologically identical genetic assemblages, further divided into sub-assemblages. There is very little information available on the diversity of Giardia sub-assemblages and multi-locus genotypes infecting people in the United Kingdom. In this study we studied the molecular epidemiology of Giardia in symptomatic patients from North West England.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Whole faecal DNA was extracted from the faecal samples of 406 Giardia cases and the parasites assemblage, sub-assemblage and multi-locus genotype were determined using PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the beta-giardin, glutamate dehydrogenase, triose-phosphate isomerase and small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes. Information about age, gender and self-reported clinical outcomes was also collected from the patients to check for differences associated with the infecting Giardia assemblage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our results showed a difference in the age prevalence of the two assemblages, with assemblage A being more common in older cases. Cases infected with assemblage B more often reported vomiting and a longer illness than cases infected with assemblage A. The majority of infections (64{\%}) were caused by assemblage B followed by assemblage A (33{\%}), while mixed-assemblage infections were rare (3{\%}). Assemblage A isolates mostly belonged to the sub-assemblage AII and showed completed identity with previously described isolates. The level of genetic sub-structuring was significantly higher in assemblage B isolates, since a higher proportion of novel assemblage B sequences was detected compared to assemblage A. A high number of assemblage B sequences showed heterogeneous nucleotide positions that prevented the unambiguous assignment to a specific sub-assemblage. Both previously described and novel multi-locus genotypes were described in both assemblages, and up to 17 different assemblage B multi-locus genotypes were found.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have produced the first data on the parasite multi-locus genotypes in the UK and have demonstrated that the molecular diversity of Giardia is similar to other developed countries. Furthermore, we showed that the parasite assemblages infecting humans may be associated with patients of different ages and with different clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {Although giardiasis is considered by most medical practitioners to be an easily treated infection, prolonged symptoms due to, or following, Giardia duodenalis infection can have a significant impact on quality of life. Symptom recurrence, including abdominal symptoms and fatigue, can result from re-infection, treatment failure, disturbances in the gut mucosa or post-infection syndromes. In developed countries, these sequelae can have an enormous impact on quality of life; in developing countries, particularly in children, they add yet another burden to populations that are already disadvantaged. Here, we outline current knowledge, based on individual case sequelae from sporadic infections, observations of population effects following outbreaks and studies of phenotypic and genotypic diversity between morphologically identical isolates of parasites. We also raise further questions, looking for clues as to why giardiasis sometimes becomes an intrusive, long-term problem.},

@article{Nhacolo2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Mozambique most of demographic data are obtained using census or sample survey including indirect estimations. A method of collecting longitudinal demographic data was introduced in southern Mozambique since 1996 (DSS -Demographic Surveillance System in Manhi{\c{c}}a district, Maputo province), but the extent to which it yields demographic measures that are typical of southern rural Mozambique has not been evaluated yet. METHODS: Data from the DSS were used to estimate the levels and trends of fertility, mortality and migration in Manhi{\c{c}}a, between 1998 and 2005. The estimates from Manhi{\c{c}}a were compared with estimates from Maputo province using the 1997 National census and 1997 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The DHS data were used to estimate levels and trends of adult mortality using the siblings' histories and the orphanhood methods. RESULTS: The populations in Manhi{\c{c}}a and in Maputo province are young (44{\%} {\textless}15 years in Manhi{\c{c}}a and 42{\%} in Maputo); with reduced adult males when compared to females (all ages sex ratio of 78.7 in Manhi{\c{c}}a and 89 in Maputo). Fertility in Manhi{\c{c}}a is at a similar level as in Maputo province and has remained around 5 children per woman, during the eight years of surveillance in Manhi{\c{c}}a. Although the infant mortality rate (IMR) in Mozambique has decreased during the last two decades (from 148 deaths per 1000 live births in 1980 to 101 in 2003), it has remained stable around 80 in Manhi{\c{c}}a during the surveillance period. Adult mortality has increased both in Manhi{\c{c}}a (probability of dying from ages 15 to 60 increased from 0.4 in 1998 to 0.6 in 2005 in Manhi{\c{c}}a, from 0.3 in 1992 to 0.4 in 1997 in Maputo province and from 0.1 in 1980 to 0.6 in 2000 in Mozambique). Consequently, the life expectancy decreased from 53 to 46 in Manhi{\c{c}}a and from 42 years in 1997 to 38 in 2004 in Mozambique. Migration is high in Manhi{\c{c}}a but tends to stabilise after the movements of resettlement that followed the end of the civil war in 1992. CONCLUSION: The population under demographic surveillance in Manhi{\c{c}}a district presents characteristics that are typical of southern rural Mozambique, with predominance of young people and reduction of adult males. Labour migration and excess adult male mortality are the major factors for the reduction of adult males. Mortality is high and only infant mortality has started to stabilise while adult mortality has increased, and as consequence, life expectancy has decreased. The Manhi{\c{c}}a DSS is an adequate tool to report demographic measures for southern rural Mozambique.},

Intestinal parasites, which include protozoan and helmints, are responsible for frequent infections in humans all over the world. These infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality especially in tropical and subtropical regions. The aim of this work was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites infections, namely caused by protozoa, in children hospitalized at the section of diarrhea (ICd) in the Infectious-Contagious Diseases service and at the Malnutrition service (MN) of the Department of Pediatrics of the Hospital Central de Maputo (HCM), Mozambique. For parasite identification we used both conventional parasitological and molecular methods, the later only for detection and identification of G.lamblia, E.histolytica, E.dispar and E.moshkovskii. Stool samples of 104 children between 2 and 94 months old were obtained for parasite detection. 43.3{\%} of the children were hospitalized at the ICd Service and the remaining 56.7{\%} at the MN service. Parasitological analysis revealed that 32.7{\%} (34/104) of the children were infected with at least one pathogenic parasite. These included the protozoa G.lamblia (6.7{\%}) and Cryptosporidium (15.4{\%}) and the helminths Trichuris trichiura (11.5{\%}) and Ascaris lumbricoides (2.9{\%}). Molecular analysis of all stool samples revealed that 17.3{\%} of the children were infected with G.lamblia, 9.6{\%} with E.histolytica and 1.9{\%} with E.moshkovskii DNA. While microscopy was able to detect part of the children infected with G. lamblia, all infections with Entamoeba remained undetected with microscopy. The association of PCR and microscopy detected 19.2{\%} G.lamblia infections. All but one children in whom the molecular methods detected either Giardia or E. histolytica presented diarrhea. Genotyping of G.lamblia has shown that genotype B (77.8{\%}, 14/18) was clearly more prevalent that genotype A (16.7{\%}, 3/18). No difference was observed in terms of clinical presentation. This study has contributed to a better understanding of giardiasis, amebiasis and cryptosporidiosis in Mozambique.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intestinal parasites are important contributors to the global disease burden, especially in children of low-income countries. The present study determined the frequency of intestinal parasites in children hospitalized at the diarrhea section of the Infectious-Contagious Diseases ward and at the Malnutrition ward of the Department of Pediatrics of the Maputo Central Hospital in Mozambique.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: This pilot study conducted between February and March 2009 enrolled a total of 93 children between 1.5 and 48.2 months of age; 87.1{\%} were younger than 24 months. Parasite detection in stool samples was achieved using direct microscopic observation and Ritchie's concentration technique.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Infection with pathogenic intestinal parasites was detected in 16.1{\%} (15/93) of the children. Giardia duodenalis and Trichuris trichiura were the most common parasites (6.5{\%}, 6/93 each), followed by Ascaris lumbricoides (2.2{\%}, 2/93). One case of mixed infection with A. lumbricoides plus T. trichiura was also detected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study reinforces the importance of routinely examining stool samples for the diagnosis of intestinal parasites (including protozoa) in children hospitalized in endemic areas.},

@article{Guidetti2011,
abstract = {The purpose of this survey is to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasites in a population of Mozambican students. Ninety five faecal samples were collected at the three schools in Marrere, Mozambique, for a period of about one week. Observations of fresh and Giemsa-stained samples were performed at the laboratory of the Geral de Marrere Hospital; observation after concentration (FEA) was performed later at the Microbiology Laboratory of the S. Maria Nuova Hospital (Reggio Emilia, Italy). The results show a high rate of intestinal parasites among the subjects examined, supported mainly by helminths (Strongyloides stercoralis and Ancylostoma/Necator americanus), and protozoa (Dientamoeba fragilis and Giardia intestinalis). Analysis of data shows that the search for pathogenic parasites with the formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) stool concentration technique shows higher sensitivity than the observation of fresh samples (60{\%} vs 30{\%}) and in some cases allows the presence of a second or third parasite to be detected. The high rate of parasitosis in endemic areas underlines the importance of lending greater attention to immigrant patients in Italy, due also to the fact that parasitosis is often found in asymptomatic forms.},

@article{Nunes2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Current control policies for intestinal parasitosis focuses on soil-transmitted helminths, being ineffective against Giardia intestinalis, a highly prevalent protozoon that impacts children's nutritional status in developing countries. The objective of this study was to explore spatial and molecular epidemiology of Giardia intestinalis in children of Amerindian descent in the Brazilian Amazon. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A cross sectional survey was performed in the Brazilian Amazon with 433 children aged 1 to 14 years. Fecal samples were processed through parasitological techniques and molecular characterization. Prevalence of G. intestinalis infection was 16.9{\%} (73/433), reaching 22.2{\%} (35/158) among children aged 2-5 years, and a wide distribution throughout the city with some hot spots. Positivity-rate was similar among children living in distinct socioeconomic strata (48/280 [17.1{\%}] and 19/116 [16.4{\%}] below and above the poverty line, respectively). Sequencing of the $\beta$-giardin gene revealed 52.2{\%} (n = 12) of assemblage A and 47.8{\%} (n = 11) of assemblage B with high haplotype diversity for the latter. The isolates clustered into two well-supported G. intestinalis clades. A total of 38 haplotypes were obtained, with the following subassemblages distribution: 5.3{\%} (n = 2) AII, 26.3{\%} (n = 10) AIII, 7.9{\%} (n = 3) BIII, and 60.5{\%} (n = 23) new B genotypes not previously described. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Giardia intestinalis infection presents a high prevalence rate among Amerindian descended children living in Santa Isabel do Rio Negro/Amazon. The wide distribution observed in a small city suggests the presence of multiple sources of infection, which could be related to environmental contamination with feces, possibly of human and animal origin, highlighting the need of improving sanitation, safe water supply and access to diagnosis and adequate treatment of infections.},
